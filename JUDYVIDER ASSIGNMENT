            <h2 id="what-is-it">What is Semantic HTML?</h2>
            <p>Semantic HTML, or semantic markup, is the use of HTML tags to reinforce the meaning of the information in web pages rather than simply defining its presentation or appearance. It leverages tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to give the browser, search engines, and screen readers a clear understanding of the page's structure and content.</p>
        </article>

        <!-- The 'section' element is a thematic grouping of content. -->
        <section>
            <h2 id="why-use-it">Why Use Semantic HTML?</h2>
            <p>The benefits of using a semantic structure are numerous. It improves the accessibility of your website for users with disabilities, makes your content more understandable for search engine crawlers, and results in cleaner, more maintainable code for developers.</p>
            <h3>Key Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Assistive technologies like screen readers rely on semantic tags to navigate a page and convey meaning to the user.</li>
                <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Search engines prioritize well-structured, semantic content, which can improve your page's ranking.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Code is easier to read and debug when elements clearly define their purpose.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>The Difference Between a 'div' and a 'section'</h3>
                <p>A <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a generic container with no semantic meaning. It's often used for styling purposes. In contrast, a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> is a container for a thematic group of content, typically with a heading. While they may appear similar visually, their underlying purpose for accessibility and SEO is vastly different.</p>
